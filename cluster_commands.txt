Commands for Computing on EDDIE

- jobs can be submitted with
qsub <script.sh>,
where script.sh is a submission script

- submitted or running jobs can be monitored with
qstat;
this also displays the IDs of the jobs

- submitted or running jobs can be killed with
qdel <job ID>,
where the job ID can be found via qstat

Please find your own sensible structure for either different job schedulers that
is understandable for both people in TÃ¼bingen and Edinburgh.

Before running jobs in any cluster, please bear in mind LOGIN NODES are not RUNNING NODES
Also be careful with the memory assignated to each job, an useful practice would be to read the cluster documentation before hand
In case some information is missed in your university webpage, general instructions can be found in the webpages related to your specific queue system
